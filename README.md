TeeBotMax
=========

This is TeeBotMax printed parts (all STL files)
Designed by Emmanuel Adetutu (Teetopsy)
TeeBotMax is a RepRap printer. 
The design is highly inspired by the fantastic Foldarap and Prusa I3 3D printers.
The Idea was to design and develop a 3D printer which is simple to build, easy to move around and travel with, built with simple materials and equally strong and precise.
